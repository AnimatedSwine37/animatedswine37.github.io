Welcome to Swine's Suite! 

This site currently exists mainly as a place to put [my portfolio](/portfolio), however, I would like to actually do some blogging here as well. 
I'm not sure exactly what I'll write about but it'll most likely be focused on modding and programming, maybe with some general gaming stuff for good measure.

In the meantime, as well as [my portfolio](/portfolio) I have made a nice [about me](/about) page where you can learn a bit more about me.

That's all for now, hopefully there'll be some more interesting posts on here in the future. Have a nice day :)
